## Build the application

### 1. Get the source code

```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/mcalvog/Movies.git
```

### 2. Configure the project

The movies information provided in this application belongs to **themoviedb.org**, so you need an API Key from their platform in order to display it. You can get one from [this link](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started/introduction).

Once you have it, create a _keystore.properties_ file at the root folder with the following information:

```
THE_MOVIE_DB_API_KEY=YOUR API KEY HERE
```

Replace "YOUR API KEY HERE" with your API Key from themoviedb.
